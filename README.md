# movie_successrate_pred

# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the success of movies using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features like the director's name, genre, time duration, and other factors, which are used to train different models.

# Models Used
We implement and compare the following machine learning models:

Random Forest
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
# Hyperparameter Tuning
To enhance the performance of the models, hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. This helps in finding the optimal parameters for each model.

# Model Evaluation
The models are compared based on their performance using the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, which helps in selecting the best model by measuring the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.

# LIME Explanation
To ensure that our model predictions are interpretable and valid, we use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). LIME helps us to explain the predictions made by our best-performing model and ensure that the results make sense for real-world use.
